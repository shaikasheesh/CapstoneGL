# This is My Capstone Project That I have built when I was doing my PGP-Data Science in Great Lakes
I have Worked on the Financial Data Set to classify the organisation data whether it is bankrupt or not

We have Perfomed EDA, Feature Engineering & Studied properties of all the variables and Finally understood the nature of the dataset.

We have tried implementing various models which can be viewed in Model_building.ipynb file where we have mainly focussed on reducing Recall while having a good balance with Precision & Accuracy. We have also done Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch CV


Model Outputs & Project Synopsis documents are also uploaded for reference purpose
